# Extended BEHAV3D Pipeline

This README is part of the extended BEHAV3D pipeline documentation, which builds upon the initial [BEHAV3D repository](https://github.com/AlievaRios/BEHAV3D). It includes additional features and modules to enhance the dynamic immuno-organoid 3D imaging-transcriptomics platform capabilities for studying tumor death dynamics, immune cell behavior, and behavior-guided transcriptomics.

## Overview

The extended BEHAV3D pipeline introduces new functionalities and integrates more deeply with transcriptomic data, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the interactions between immune cells and tumor organoids. This document will guide you through the added features and how to apply them to your existing BEHAV3D setup.

## Continuation of BEHAV3D

This pipeline is a continuation of the original BEHAV3D platform. It assumes familiarity with the initial setup and use of BEHAV3D as detailed in the [original repository](https://github.com/AlievaRios/BEHAV3D). If you are new to BEHAV3D, please refer to the original documentation before proceeding with this extended version.

## Additional Data Types and Outputs

### What additional types of data does the extended BEHAV3D work with?

- [//]: # (Commented instructions: Describe any new data types that the extended pipeline can process, such as additional imaging modalities or integration with other types of 'omics' data.)

### What additional outputs does the extended BEHAV3D provide?

- [//]: # (Commented instructions: List new outputs that the extended pipeline will generate, such as advanced visualizations, integration with genomic data, etc.)

## Citing the Extended Pipeline
